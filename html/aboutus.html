                      <p>VhoTel is more than just a normal hotel. It is a legacy of love and passion that spans over two decades. The story of VhoTel began in 1999, when a young couple, Victor and Tara, decided to pursue their dream of opening their own hotel in Jakarta. They had met and fallen in love while pursuing their hospitality degree in a university in Jakarta, and they wanted to bring their expertise and knowledge to reality.</p>

                      <p>They found an old building in the center of the city that had been abandoned for some years. They saw the potential of the place, and they decided to buy and renovate it, transforming the building into a modern and elegant hotel. They named it VhoTel, combining their first letter from their names. Their vision of creating a hotel is to make their guests feel like they were at home.</p>

                <div class="story-content">
                    <p>VhoTel soon became a popular destination for people from inside and outside the country. It also became a place where Victor and Tara raised their child, who grew up with the warmth of VhoTel. He learned from his parents the importance of hospitality, excellence, and innovation for a hotel.</p>

                    <p>Today, VhoTel is still run by the couple, along with their only child, who have learned their passion and their vision of VhoTel. They have expanded the hotel building to include more rooms, facilities, and services, but they have never compromised on the quality and the standards that have made VhoTel a widely-known legendary hotel in Jakarta.</p>
